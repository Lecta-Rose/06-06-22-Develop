        issue in June 2008. The North American translation was launched in August 2003 and ran until October 2009.</div>
    <div class="box box2">The manga has been adapted into various mediums, some before the manga itself had finished serialization.
        It was first adapted as an audio drama released on CD from July 1993 to July 1994. This was followed by a live-action
        feature film in 1995, then an anime television series, produced by Toei Animation, that aired on ABC in 1996. The first
        live-action television adaptation, Meteor Garden (Taiwan, 2001â€“2002), was also produced before the manga was completed.</div>
    <div class="box box3">A number of other live-action television adaptations have since followed, influenced both by the
        completion of the manga and the success of prior adaptations. Hana yori Dango aired in Japan from 2005 to 2007 (and was
        followed by a 2008 film). The South Korean adaptation, Boys Over Flowers aired in 2009, followed in 2018 by the official
        Chinese adaptation Meteor Garden. A Thai adaptation, F4 Thailand: Boys Over Flowers, was aired in Thailand from 2021 to
        2022</div>
