<h1>Meteor Garden</h1>

<body>
    <p class="mytext2">Shan Cai, whose parents are far from wealthy, attends Ying De University, the private school
        established exclusively for rich students. Besides being looked down by rich classmates, she has angered the
        leader of F4, Dao Ming Si. F4 comprises of Dao Ming Si, Hua Ze Lei, Xi Men, and Mei Zuo, who are the heirs
        to the four richest families. Their families are the founder of the school and nobody dares to cross them.
        Shan Cai isn't afraid to stand up to Dao Ming Si, an act that nobody has done before, and sparks Dao Ming Si's
        interest in her. However, his constant torture of her has made her miserable while she falls in love with the
        gentle Hua Ze Lei, who comes to her rescue. Can Dao Ming Si win her love despite his cold and cruel exterior?
        What happens when his mother decides to use every trick there is to keep them apart? Can they adjust to each
        other's differences due to their vastly incompatible social status?</p>
